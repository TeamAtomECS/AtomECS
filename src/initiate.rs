//! A module responsible for initiating newly created atoms.
//!
//! When new atoms are added to the simulation, a [NewlyCreated](struct.NewlyCreated.html)
//! component is attached. This provides a signal that modules can use to identify which
//! atoms are new, and thus to attach any required components. For instance, the `magnetics`
//! module attaches a [MagneticFieldSampler](struct.MagneticFieldSampler.html) to new atoms
//! so that the `magnetics` systems can calculate fields at each atom's location.
//!
//! This module defines the [NewlyCreated](struct.NewlyCreated.html) component, and also the
//! system responsible for cleaning up these components each integration step.

/// This system runs *just before* new atoms are added to the world.
/// Thus, any atoms flagged as [NewlyCreated] from the previous frame are deflagged before the new flagged atoms are created.
